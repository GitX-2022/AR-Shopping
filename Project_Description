Augmented reality (AR) is the integration of digital information with the user's environment in real time. Unlike virtual reality (VR), which creates a totally artificial environment, AR users experience a real-world environment with generated perceptual information overlaid on top of it.

Our project involves building an application that makes use of augmented reality to visualize furniture before buying them.

We use Unity engine and AR Foundation (which in turn enables the generalization of code to build for both iOS and Android using ARKit and ARCore).

We also use C# in order to animate any of the Game Objects placed in the AR Screen.
